This execuable file is a 3-d elasto-plastic slope stability program closely based on 
Program 6.10 in the text "Programming the finite element method" 4th edition, 
by I.M. Smith and D.V. Griffiths, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

The program is not fully documented but includes more user friendly data structures and the 
"auto_FS" search facility similar to that used in programs slope1 and slope2.

To run the program double-click on the icon slope3.exe At the prompt, type in the base name 
of the data file. If you want to run the example data file slope3.dat, the base name would involve
just the name before the period, namely "slope3"

Note that all data files to be used in this system of programs must have the extension *.dat.
